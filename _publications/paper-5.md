### Abstract:

In China, carbon emissions are not only related to economic growth but also affected by politics. This article collects carbon dioxide emission data and the date of the Provincial Communist Party Congress(PCPC) from 2006 to 2019 in 283 prefecturelevel cities in China to study how the PCPC impacts carbon emissions. Using the Fixed-Effects Model, we find that the carbon emissions in prefecture level cities form cyclical fluctuations within the convening of the PCPC. To be specific, the amount of
carbon emissions has decreased by 253.4 thousand tons on average in the first year before the opening of the local communist party congress compared with that in the third year after the opening of the local communist party congress. Furthermore, we find that the political carbon emission cycle does not belong to the environmental political business cycle and co-exists with the political business cycle. These results suggest that carbon emissions reduction has become as important as economic growth in the cadre evaluation system nowadays.
