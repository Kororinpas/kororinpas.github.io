From July to August 2020, I participated in the Hog Farming Project of Shanghai University, under the guidance of Professor Liu Yazhou. During this project, I:

- Conducted surveys in rural areas across three provinces and one municipality, investigating the production dilemma and the status of work resumption in the context of swine fever.
- Acquired insights into recent conditions of hog production by interviewing government officials, staff from large-scale farming enterprises, and insurance companies, and by conducting questionnaire surveys with farmers.
- Provided recommendations for ensuring the stable supply of pork by examining changes in our country's hog production structure.
