### Descritpion

At the end of August 2023, I participated in the SMU AI Hackathon. During the competition, we leveraged large language models, ChatGPT, and the SMU library's API to create an automated literature review generator. Users simply input the keywords of the literature they wish to search, and the tool automatically retrieves relevant literature, filters it, and generates a literature review to succinctly help organize the context of the relevant works. In developing this program, we designed PDF_Framer to segment papers by chapters in PDFs, which enhances the retrieval of the most relevant sections during the Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) process. This project received Honorable Mentions in the "Generate your AI Library" Hackathon at Singapore Management University.
