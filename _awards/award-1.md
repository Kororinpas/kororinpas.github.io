### Descritpion

Between May and June 2023, I participated in the First National Large Language Model Innovation and Creative Application Competition in China. Teamed up with five classmates, we utilized large language models such as ChatGPT and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to develop tools to assist with academic writing in economics and management. Specifically, we created two programs: Intro-Genius and Lit-Cite. Intro-Genius is designed to generate introductions that match the style of top-tier journals based on the content of the article, while Lit-Cite is an automated citation tool that adds references based on sentence semantics. These two programs are the main components of our Lit-Tool suite. The gif below demonstrates the specific usage process of our Lit-Cite demo. Our program won third prize at the First National Large Language Model Innovation and Creative Application Competition in China.
