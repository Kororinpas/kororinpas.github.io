### Description:

This project is primarily designed to gather research data for my working paper titled "Cheat and Get Promoted: The Political GDP Manipulation Cycle in China." In our study, we emulate the methodology of Chen et al. (2021) in their paper "Chasing or cheating? Theory and evidence on Chinaâ€™s GDP manipulation" by using nighttime light data. We employ the XGBoost algorithm to calibrate the annual GDP data for China's prefecture-level cities. Each file in the repository is detailed as follows:

- merged.csv: Contains the nightlight data alongside the official GDP figures for China.
- xgboost_new.ipynb: Utilizes XGBoost and LightGBM to predict the actual GDP in China.
