### Description:

I developed this program while working as a part-time Research Assistant for Professor Zhang Xuan at Singapore Management University. Professor Zhang tasked me with researching and comparing the ratings of specified hospitals in China. To accomplish this, I utilized Python's Playwright library to search for and scrape rating information from both Baidu and Google. The details of the project files are as follows:

- hospital_level.py: This is the main script of the web scraping tool. It is designed to automatically scrape data about hospital rankings from specified sources.
- hospital_search.csv: This file contains the results of the scraping process. It lists hospitals along with their respective rankings and other relevant details as obtained from the web.
