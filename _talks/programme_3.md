### Description:
![Lit-Cite](/images/lit_cite.gif "Lit-Cite Demo")

Lit_Cite is a software tool that I designed, leveraging AI and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. Its primary purpose is to simplify the citation process for researchers. The main steps involve uploading a potential paper in PDF format to generate a library of 10-20 potential citations. The program automatically identifies all the pertinent information from these papers. Next, you input paragraphs from your article, highlight the sentences that require citations, and the software uses a word vector matching algorithm to find the semantically most relevant sentences from the library. Once selected, the citation is automatically added. This program won the Third Prize at the First National Large Language Model Innovation and Creative Application Competition in China.
