### Description:

I used the dataset from lvwerra/stack-exchange-paired to perform LoRA fine-tuning on the open-source large language model LLAMA, enabling it to answer certain questions on Stack Overflow. This project involved replicating someone else's project code, primarily to familiarize myself with the fine-tuning process for large language models.
